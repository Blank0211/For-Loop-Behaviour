# For-Loop-Behaviour

This (Python) code is supposed to explain For Loop's unexpected behaviour
As a complete beginner, it was difficult to get the hang of how For Loops actually work.
The initial goal of this code was to filter out vowels from a "List" using a For Loop (which obviously did'nt work as it should).

If anyone has a better way to explain it, i'll really appreciate the help.
